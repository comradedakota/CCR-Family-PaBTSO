# NPC: Cragmaw Goblins

[![alt text](../media/chapter01/011-01-002.cragmaw-goblin-ambush.webp "The Cragmaw goblins love ambushing unsuspecting travelers in the wilderness")](../media/chapter01/011-01-002.cragmaw-goblin-ambush.webp)

The Cragmaw _(aptly named because their members sharpen their teeth to jagged points to make them look fiercer)_ are a [goblin](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#goblin_mm) tribe that has been plundering any poorly defended caravans or travelers that traverse the Triboar Trail.

Their leader is a bugbear named [Klarg](./klarg.md).

### Yeemik <hr>
A [goblin boss](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#goblin%20boss_mm) with political aspirations, Yeemik wants to overthrow Klarg and become the new leader of the Cragmaw tribe. He has asked the party to aid him in this endeavor, in exchange for the safe release of [Sildar](./sildar-hallwinter.md), safe passage for the group, and Yeemik's word that _(under his command)_ the Cragmaw will no longer raid caravans/wagons/etc on the Triboar Trail.

### Errk <hr>
A goblin boss who was oblilterated by the deadly Eldritch Blast of the [Tiefling](https://5e.tools/races.html#tiefling_phb) [warlock](https://5e.tools/classes.html#warlock_phb) known as Corvin.

**What the Cragmaws know:**
<details>
<summary><em><strong>Bugbear Leader</strong></em></summary>
Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. Klarg reports to King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw band, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. <em>(The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It's about twenty miles northeast, in Neverwinter Wood.)</em><br /><br />
</details>
<details>
<summary><em><strong>Capturing Gundren</strong></em></summary>
Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named <em>"the Spider"</em> was paying the Cragmaws to capture Gundren Rockseeker and send him and anything he was carrying to King Grol. Klarg followed King Grol's orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken with his personal effects—including a map—to King Grol.<br /><br />
</details>
<details>
<summary><em><strong>Sildar's Location</strong></em></summary>
Gundren's human companion is being held in the <em>"eating cave"</em> <em><strong>(area H6)</strong></em>. About fifteen goblins currently dwell in this hideout.
</details>
<details>
<summary><em><strong>Strange Goblins</strong></em></summary>
Recently, strange goblins have sometimes joined the Cragmaws in their roadside ambushes, though not today. These strange goblins have elongated skulls, and glowing green energy surrounds their weapons when they attack.<br /><br />

The Cragmaw goblins don't know who these newcomers are; the new goblins simply cackle and leave after each attack. The Cragmaws are afraid of these strange goblins and think the characters should be, too. <em>(This is a reference to the psionic goblins that factor more prominently in later chapters.)</em>
