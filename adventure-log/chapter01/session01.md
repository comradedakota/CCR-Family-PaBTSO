###  *The Adventure Begins... Goblin Ambush!*

After agreeing to accompany a supply wagon from Neverwinter to Phandalin for Gundren Rockseeker, our brave group of adventurers set forth on a southbound trail… Little do they know that a band of caravan-robbing goblins called the Cragmaw are waiting to ambush the party en route. Luckily, the adventurers survive two separate attempts to raid the wagon and even manage to capture a cowardly goblin as it attempts to flee the encounter.

After interrogating the goblin at length, the party learns that the Cragmaw have a nearby hideout and set off to find where Sildar Hallwinter, Gundren Rockseeker’s human bodyguard, has be taken to. Dodging several hastily laid traps, our heroes found themselves at the mouth of a massive cave and the sun quickly setting.

    <summary><strong>What the Cragmaws Know</strong></summary>
<br />
Cragmaw goblins the characters capture can be persuaded to divulge the following information:<br /><br />

<strong>Bugbear Leader</strong>. Their leader is a bugbear named Klarg. Klarg reports to King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw band, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. <em>(The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It's about twenty miles northeast, in Neverwinter Wood.)</em><br /><br />
    
<strong>Capturing Gundren</strong>. Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named "the Spider" was paying the Cragmaws to capture Gundren Rockseeker and send him and anything he was carrying to King Grol. Klarg followed King Grol's orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken with his personal effects—including a map—to King Grol.<br /><br />
    
<strong>Sildar's Location</strong>. Gundren's human companion is being held in the "eating cave" (area H6). About fifteen goblins currently dwell in this hideout.<br /><br />
    
<strong>Strange Goblins</strong>. Recently, strange goblins have sometimes joined the Cragmaws in their roadside ambushes, though not today. These strange goblins have elongated skulls, and glowing green energy surrounds their weapons when they attack. The Cragmaw goblins don't know who these newcomers are; the new goblins simply cackle and leave after each attack. The Cragmaws are afraid of these strange goblins and think the characters should be, too. <em>(This is a reference to the psionic goblins that factor more prominently in later chapters.)</em>
