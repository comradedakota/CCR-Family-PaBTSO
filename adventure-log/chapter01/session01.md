###  *The Adventure Begins... Goblin Ambush!*

After agreeing to accompany a supply wagon from Neverwinter to Phandalin for Gundren Rockseeker, our brave group of adventurers set forth on a southbound trail… Little do they know that a band of caravan-robbing goblins called the Cragmaw are waiting to ambush the party en route. Luckily, the adventurers survive two separate attempts to raid the wagon and even manage to capture a cowardly goblin as it attempts to flee the encounter.

After interrogating the goblin at length, the party learns that the Cragmaw have a nearby hideout and set off to find where Sildar Hallwinter, Gundren Rockseeker’s human bodyguard, has be taken to. Dodging several hastily laid traps, our heroes found themselves at the mouth of a massive cave and the sun quickly setting.
